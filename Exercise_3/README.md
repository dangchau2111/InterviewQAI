# Neural Network with Triplet Loss

This project implements a neural network with a triplet loss function to classify the MNIST dataset. The following sections provide an overview of the code and how it works.

## Overview

The code demonstrates:
1. Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
2. Implementing a simple neural network using NumPy.
3. Training the model with triplet loss.
4. Evaluating the model's accuracy.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```sh
pip install numpy scikit-learn
